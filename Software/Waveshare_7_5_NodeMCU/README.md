# Project15-ESP32-7.5_epaper

Simple ESP32 project including a 7.5 inch Waveshare epaper display. 

This is based off a simple project I downloaded from somewhere (note to self - link that project here). Its aim is to purely check that the board works and to see how it draws to the screen and updates.
